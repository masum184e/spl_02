# Software Project Lab 02 (SPL-02)

Software Project Lab 02 (SPL-02) is a web and database–oriented software development course under the curriculum of Software Engineering. This course emphasizes practical experience in full-stack web application development, including frontend design, backend logic, and database management.

Unlike SPL-01, which is an individual Java OOP–based project, SPL-02 is a group-based project course, where students collaboratively design, develop, and deploy a complete web-based system following proper software engineering principles.

# Our Project - VroomGo

During the early academic phase, the project was named **Odyssey**, and later rebranded as **VroomGo** to better reflect its modern, dynamic, and user-friendly vision.

VroomGo is a car rental platform developed as part of the **Software Project Lab 02 (SPL-02)** course. Although SPL-02 primarily focuses on web application development, our project was designed to include both web and mobile applications based on the guidance of our course supervisor.

The mobile application is developed to provide a more convenient and user-friendly experience for renters and vehicle owners, as mobile platforms are more accessible for day-to-day usage. On the other hand, the web application serves as an administrative dashboard, enabling administrators to efficiently manage users, vehicles, bookings, and overall platform operations.

VroomGo aims to deliver a seamless vehicle rental experience by connecting renters, vehicle owners, and administrators through a unified system. The platform allows users to search, book, and manage vehicles efficiently while ensuring secure transactions, transparent pricing, and effective administrative control.

## Objectives

The primary objective of VroomGo is to provide a convenient, reliable, and efficient solution for short-term vehicle rentals. The platform is designed to simplify the rental process by enabling users to search for vehicles, make bookings, manage profiles, and complete payments through a secure mobile interface.

Additionally, VroomGo aims to empower vehicle owners with tools to manage vehicle listings, availability, and rental history, while providing administrators with full oversight of users, vehicles, and platform operations. Through this project, the team applies mobile development as well as full-stack web development concepts, database management, and software engineering best practices in a real-world context.
